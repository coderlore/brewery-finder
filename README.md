## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The client requested for a web app they could use to search for local breweries in their area. I chose to use the open brewery database API to select the breweries around the area as it provided the client with the information they were seeking (e.g. name of brewery, phone number, and website).

## Optimizations

Future optimization includes added search features. The ability to search by city would be a nice feature. Also adding the ability to search different countries is another future optimization. 

## Lessons Learned:

Implementing the API's information and parsing out the correct data was the first challenge. Once the correct data was parsed out, the next challenge was outputting the data to a table. Also ensuring the multiple breweries were visually separated by varying color, further helped the client see there were multiple options to choose from.
